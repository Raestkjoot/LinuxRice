Ensuring a good start to the next day and that dirt and tasks will not pile up and become overwhelming."
"\"Have you eaten your rice porridge? I have eaten. Then you had better wash your bowl.\" Perhaps a story about just doing the next thing.

"Get code done quickly, get code done robustly, make code simple, finish what you write, and have broad knowledge of advanced ideas and techniques, but only use them when they are genuinely helpful."
